# _printf funtion 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
## Recreate a printf() funtion in c.
The printf function creates an output of a character string in
accordance to a specific format. If the function is successful it will
return the number of characters printed. The format is a string of
characters that the function prints. The function goes through each
character in the string and prints. When a % sign is reached and the
following character is a special character then a specific conversion
will occur.
